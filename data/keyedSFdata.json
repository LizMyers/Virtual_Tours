The Powell-Hyde line runs from the huge turnaround near Market and Powell, and goes to Fisherman's Wharf near Ghirardelli Square. Insider tip: don't start from one of the turnarounds: instead walk a few blocks down the line, and wave down the cable car there. The lines at the turnarounds can be over an hour long, but there is no line at the middle stops.",
